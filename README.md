## How it works

This project is divided into three parts:

1. [Backend](https://github.com/Ives-Gomes/Ecoleta-API)
2. [Frontend](https://github.com/Ives-Gomes/Ecoleta)
3. Mobile

Both Frontend and Mobile need the Backend to be running to work.

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
Download the [Expo](https://expo.io/) application on your phone. In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

#### Start Frontend (mobile)

```bash

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Ives-Gomes/Ecoleta-Mobile.git

# Access the project folder cmd/terminal
$ cd Ecoleta-Mobile
